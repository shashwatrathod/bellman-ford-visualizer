                The <strong>Bellman-Ford</strong> algorithm computes shortest
                paths from a single source vertex to every other vertext in a
                weighted (,and in our case, directed) graph. Unlike the more
                popular Djikstra's algorithm, this algorithm is capable of
                finding shortest paths even in graphs with negative edge weights
                (but no negative weight cycles). The main idea is that the
                maximum length of the shortest path to any other vertex can be
                no more than <code>|V| - 1</code> where <code>|V|</code>
                is the number of vertices in the graph. Therefore, if we{" "}
                <i>relax</i> all edges <code>|V| - 1</code> times, we will end
                up with the shortest path from source to given vertices.{" "}

                    Vertices are represented by opaque, filled circles. The text
                    a circle represents name of the vertex. If you've started
                    execution of Bellman Ford, you may notice some digits to the
                    right side of a <code>:</code> in these circles. These
                    digits represent the vertex's minimum distance from the{" "}
                    <var>source</var>.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A <span style={{ color: "#2196F3" }}>blue</span> vertex
                    represents the source node. A{" "}
                    <span style={{ color: "#4CAF50" }}>green</span> vertex
                    represents a vertex for which the minimum distance has just
                    been updated.

                  <li>
                    Edges are presented by an arrow between two vertices. The
                    number in the middle of an arrow represents the weight of
                    that edge.

                    represents an edge for which a distance update has been

                The parent table is left table with col names "node" and
                "parent". Assume a graph with an edge from node "u" to "v". If
                the shortest path to "v" includes the edge (u,v), then "u" is
                said to be the "parent" of "v". The values in this table change
                as we move through steps of the algorithm.

              <p>
                <h5>Distance Table</h5>
                The distance table holds the value of minimum distance to a
                vertex from the source vertex. At any point,{" "}
                <code>DistanceTable[u][iter]</code> is the minimum distance from
                "source" to "u" at iteration number <code>iter</code> of
                Bellman-Ford. The values in this table change as we move through
                steps of the algorithm.
